## AppRepositoryTemplate

`AppRepositoryTemplate` is the starting point of every application made by `Atelier Socle`. After a lot of doing and redoing project setup, configuration, ... we finally decided to make our own template to have a project / repository with our full basic configuration with just a few command lines. It includes:

- A script to make your repository **ready to work in less than 5 minutes**
- An auto-generated `xcodeproj` (thanks to [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)) including: targets for `iOS`, `tvOS`, `macOS`, `watchOS`, and Notification {Service,Content) app extension.
- Basic environment setup including: `Debug`, `Release`, but also `Beta`
and `AdHoc` + their `xcconfig` files, and custom app icons
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) configuration per environment ready to go (once you have updated the firebase's plists)
- A [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) configuration** for the iOS target including `strings`, `images`, `storyboards`, and `segues`
- [SwiftLint ](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) ready to warn with its configuration file
- A [Gemfile](https://bundler.io) to easily handle gems dependencies
- A [Mintfile](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) to easily handle handle swift tools
- All the basic documentation: [README](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/blob/master/README_future.md), [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), ...
- [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) setup to build, tests,
- A [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) configuration for deployment
- ...

**Note:** Since it's just a template, it will just give basics setup, it's the developer work to finish the configuration before finalizing it's application.

## Usage

Have a full repository setup ready to be used in a few steps:

- Run `sh prepare_repository.sh {REPO_NAME} {NEW_REPO_PATH}`
- `cd {NEW_REPO_PATH}`

From here, you will have only to configure the project to match your need:

- Update the [xcconfig files](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/tree/master/config) to put your bundle identifiers, versions, team id, ...
- Update the [fastlane configuration](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/tree/master/fastlane) to match your apple id, team id, ...
- Update the [APNs script](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/tree/master/scripts/APNs) by replacing the `AuthKey` and add your information
- Read the new [README](https://github.com/atelier-socle/AppRepositoryTemplate/blob/master/README_future.md) to start working on your project
- Remove targets that you won't need in the `XcodeGen` configuration: ``
- ...

Start working on your app!
